       "### Next Steps\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Implement Flight Dynamics**: You would need to implement realistic flight dynamics. This could be done using aerodynamic equations and control surface simulations.\n",
       "2. **Add User Controls**: Implement keyboard or joystick controls to manipulate the aircraft's pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle.\n",
       "3. **Enhance Graphics**: Add textures, lighting, and shadows to make the simulation more realistic.\n",
       "4. **Sound**: Integrate engine sounds and other audio effects using Panda3D's audio management features.\n",

       "### Conclusion\n",
